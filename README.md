# CCAS Dissertation Template
LaTeX template for GWU CCAS dissertation.

This is a barebones template for a dissertation based on my final accepted version. The formatting conforms to CCAS requirements as of 12/11/2021. I can make no guarantees that this will comply with future revisions.

The template is astrophysics specific as it includes the AAS bibliography style, as well as the AAS deluxetable environment, but modifying the bibstyle to work with another journal should be straightforward.
